Pong - Nicholas Grace (ngr55), Jack Miller (jmi145)

Welcome to pong, a two player game between two UC funkits.
To load the program onto your funkit, run make program.
When the game starts, the blue led will be on, indicating the game is waiting to start. Make sure the two funkits are facing each other for best performance.
To begin, press navswitch down, the goal of the game is to hit the bouncing ball with your paddle, which you move across the bottom of the display.
Move the paddle with navswith north and south.
To hit a power shot, use navswitch west when the ball is ahead of the paddle - this will make the ball increase in speed.
When a player wins a round, the score will be displayed as two columns, until either user presses navswitch down to start the next round.
Once a player scores three points, the game is over and the score will be displayed as two double width columns.
Once the game is complete, reset both funkits (by holding button 2, then pressing the reset button) to play again.
